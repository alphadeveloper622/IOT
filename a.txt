I have picked out 4 examples that I like from the function optics and also the possible widges.
Could you program something like that? However, it must have a front end (user) that only sees graphical things or values ​​or displays or diagrams. the admin can add things in the backend if, for example, a new measurement is added. it is used for an iot project. by clicking on the individual devices on a map and then when clicking on the device the properties state battery sand humidity temperature battery etc. is displayed. the times by and large. I have 4 pages here that I like from the structure, etc. They only serve for understanding and visualization. The operation has to run via the web or via webapp, regardless of whether ios or android.

Here are 4 examples dashbords all data. It is only intended to serve as an example. The first dashboard won't be that extensive.
