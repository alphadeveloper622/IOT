Hello everybody, I would like to have a dashboard for a private use for now. I have picked out 4 examples that I like from the function optics and also the possible widges.
Could you program something like that? However, it must have a front end (user) that only sees graphical things or values ​​or displays or diagrams. the admin can add things in the backend if, for example, a new measurement is added. it is used for an iot project. by clicking on the individual devices on a map and then when clicking on the device the properties state battery sand humidity temperature battery etc. is displayed. the times by and large. I have 4 pages here that I like from the structure, etc. They only serve for understanding and visualization. The operation has to run via the web or via webapp, regardless of whether ios or android.

Here are 4 examples dashbords all data. It is only intended to serve as an example. The first dashboard won't be that extensive.

https://openremote.io/demo/ ( entry and overview with the map is good but the navigation should be on the left )

https://www.smart-hmi.de/ ( very nice elements and the drag and drop is great that should also work in the dashboard

https://thingsboard.io/ ( these are typical elements of iot devices such as air pressure temperature brightness etc.)

Good morning, thank you very much for your info. Can you give me an example of what you have created in this direction so far? Also with a demo login so that I can take a closer look and, if necessary, express questions or requests. Greetings Bernd Schlachter

hello
thanks for response.
pls wait a second.
i will analyze.
hello.
i have already analized these.
hello
i can do your website for IOT.
i can complete especially main 4pages.
hello
got it.
fist i will build user interface(frontend).
frontend will show values of IOT to graphical,diagram,chat,value and text forms.
second i will build backend for admin.
backend willl have 4 pages.
mainly.
first page will be map page.
this display place of IOT.
second page will show main funcitons of IOT.
third page will have drag& drop function.
I
moment i will read all
forth page will be overview page.
I
thats sounds good
this page will have mainly add function.
thanks
hello
I
in what are you going to program it? and do you have a reference where you have created it before?
yes.
i before have build a lots of dashbord and front sites.
i will progrmaing laravel.
laravel have good secure and extra.
ok
I
i will check this language
thanks.
i will use metronic theme.
i will not use static web similar to react,angular.
of course i know these static web language well.
but these don't match alternative to success for your project.
so i will use bootstrap,jquery and php etc.
i have one question.
what kind is your IOT device?
I
all possible or physical quantities. light would be pressure etc.
ok
i see.
before i start to work for you,i wish to know detail description for your IOTs.
because i can design correcting interface.
you have scratch for your project interface?
if no have,i will make and support.
for your agree.
I
here is an example of what i need. but this must then also be able to communicate with node red or influxdb

hello
i can complete your project nice.
i have one quetion.
yes
nice
I
ask me
what is drag-drop part for?
in your project.
I am currently trying to create an overview. the problem is that i have looked at many dashboards but have too many ideas. now i have seen that many use templates for a dashboard. mostly dajego or whatever it is called. I just want to have module templates in the admin area like display charts etc. which I can simply drag into the dashboard in the work area. then you can easily change the size of the labels etc. in the picture without typing anything.
https://meier-iot.ch/cloud-service/
it is in germany but you can use googel translate
https://meier-iot.ch/cloud-service/
here is everthing explain
I
i think the dashbord is not the biggest problem.. but thedata exchange between the host system an the dashboard right ?
hello.
i have read in detail.
https://meier-iot.ch/cloud-service/
you wish get all in this?
other word,you wish get all service explained in above site?
I
it would be good if it were prepared. do you know node red?
yes
i know node-red
I
ok
if you wish all,this is so big project.
I
with node red the data are processed and also programmed. The advantage of this is that you can connect any controller, regardless of whether PLC IOT Alexa Can Bus, etc.
right
you wish node-red programming?
or website?
I
it is the goal that it becomes so big. I should at least plan it, otherwise at some point you will rely on the wrong system. In the beginning, a dashboard that is not so complex is sufficient for me.
all right
i wish you have right plan.
no the system is node red. I do the programming in node red and transfer the data to the influxdb. but if I were to make entries in the dashboard, they have to go back to node red.
I
i hope that i have the right plan :-)
when you have plan,let me know.
i will help always you nice.

if you want you can log in to the test system. then they see more

I like that you at least ask questions. for me that means that they deal with it. what do you want to program it in? I only ask for further catering and extensions if they should come

thanks for your believe.
i will analyze.
yes ist me
it is al develop system. here are the nodes , node red, the database and grafana. on this system must plug the iot dashbord.
